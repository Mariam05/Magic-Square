# Magic-Square

<i>"A magic square is a square array of numbers consisting of the distinct positive integers 1, 2, ..., arranged 
such that the sum of the numbers in any horizontal, vertical, or main diagonal line is always the same number" </i>

This program uses the MVC (Model-View-Controller) Design Pattern to create a Magic Square application.
